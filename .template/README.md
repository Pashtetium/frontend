## Learning Objectives

<!--
    Tip: here you must be a list of learning objectives
    that cover your project
-->

- Algorithms
- I/O
- Data Representation

## Abstract

<!--
    Tip: Write a short description of what student
    will do during this project.
-->

In this project, you will create a tool called `creditcard` to:

- Validate credit card numbers.
- Generate possible card numbers.
- Get information about card brands and issuers.
- Issue new card numbers.

## Context

<!-- Tip: citation is optional -->

> Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process.
>
> â€” Alan J. Perlis. Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs

<!--
    Tip: project context here
    Project context is like an onboarding that should explain briefly
    project problem.

    Think of it like ADR's context section which describes problem.

## Resources

## General Criteria

<!--
    Tip: general criteria here
    You MUST change this points to align with your project.
-->

- No external packages or CDN imports are allowed. If not, you will get `0` grade.
- Only vanilla `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` are allowed. No external libraries or frameworks (e.g., `jQuery`, `React`) are permitted unless explicitly specified. If not, you will get `0` grade.
- The project MUST run without errors in the `console` on a modern browser.
- If the application crashes unexpectedly during the review, you will receive a `0`.
- `JavaScript` code must follow a standard [`ESLint rules`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started) and the mandatory rules listed below:

```sh
{
  "semi": "error"
  "no-console": "error",
  "no-unused-vars": "error",
  "no-var": "error",
  "no-undef": "error"
}
```

- If any linter errors or warnings are presented, you will receive a 0.
- Init or configure `package.json` to run the following command and apply the linter to all `.js` and `.ts`files:

```sh
$ npm run lint
```

## Mandatory Part

<!--
    Tip: write here what student should do

    Provide project description
    Provide examples
    Provide requirements
-->

MANDATORY PART HERE

## Support

<!--
    Tip: leave this section unchanged.
    This is a static text, which student must read in every project.
-->

If you get stuck, try your code with the example inputs from the project. You should get the same results. If not, read the description again. Maybe you missed something, or your code is wrong. After the examples work, but your answer is still wrong, make some test cases you can check by hand. See if they work with your code. Use the complete example input.

If you are still stuck, ask a friend for help or take a break and come back later.
